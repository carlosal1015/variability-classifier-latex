% All about "turning data into knowledege"
% Data flood in astronomy

% Criteria for classifiers: Accuracy/Performance, Computational complexity, Scalability, Interpretability of the model, Simplicity of the model, Preprocessing work, Robustness (how does it perform if assumptions are slightly violated)

% In the spirit of reproducible research (Donoho et al. 2008) all of the code and data necessary to reproduce all of the figures in this paper are included as auxiliary material.
